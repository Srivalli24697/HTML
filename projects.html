   <h1>chatbot</h1>
    <p>A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with humans, either through text or voice. 
        They are often used to automate tasks, provide customer service, or offer information in a conversational manner. 
        Many modern chatbots utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to understand user 
        input and provide more human-like responses.

    <p>Generative AI-powered chatbots
     The next generation of chatbots with generative AI capabilities will offer even more enhanced functionality 
     with their understanding of common language and complex queries, their ability to adapt to a user’s style of 
     conversation and use of empathy when answering users’ questions. Business leaders can clearly see this future: 
     85% of execs say generative AI will be interacting directly with customers in the next two years, as reported 
     in The CEO’s guide to generative AI study, from IBV. An enterprise-grade artificial intelligence solution can 
     empower companies to automate self-service and accelerate the development of exceptional user experiences.

     FAQ chatbots no longer need to be pre-programmed with answers to set questions: It’s easier and faster to use 
     generative AI in combination with an organization’s’ knowledge base to automatically generate answers in response
    to the wider range of questions.
     While conversational AI chatbots can digest a users’ questions or comments and generate a human-like response, 
     generative AI chatbots can take this a step further by generating new content as the output. 
     This new content can include high-quality text, images and sound based on the LLMs they are trained on. 
     Chatbot interfaces with generative AI can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and create content in
      response to a user’s query without the need for human interaction.
     Enterprise-grade, self-learning generative AI chatbots built with a conversational AI product
      are continually and automatically improving. They employ algorithms that automatically learn from past 
      interactions how best to answer questions and improve conversation flow routing.

     <h1>Project2:Twitter Sentimental Analysis</h1>
     <p>This is an entity-level sentiment analysis dataset of twitter. 
        Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. 
        There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. 
        We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral.
        Usage:
        Please use twitter_training.csv as the training set and twitter_validation.
        csv as the validation set. Top 1 classification accuracy is used as the metric.

    <h1>Project3:Face Detection</h1>
    <p>With ML Kit's face detection API, you can detect faces in an image, identify key facial features, 
        and get the contours of detected faces. Note that the API detects faces, it does not recognize people .
        Recognize and locate facial features Get the coordinates of the eyes, ears, cheeks, nose, and mouth of every face detected.
        Get the contours of facial features Get the contours of detected faces and their eyes, eyebrows, lips, and nose.
        Recognize facial expressions Determine whether a person is smiling or has their eyes closed.
        Track faces across video frames Get an identifier for each unique detected face. 
        The identifier is consistent across invocations, so you can perform image manipulation on a particular person in a video stream.
        Process video frames in real time Face detection is performed on the device, and is fast enough to be used in
        real-time applications, such as video manipulation.
